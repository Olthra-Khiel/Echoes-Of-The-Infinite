                MANKIND IS FREE.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Centuries after the initial mass space exploration program was conducted due to a conflict called the “space race”, mankind prospered with its sciences. 
                Biology freed man from the chains of diseases and famine, Philosophy freed man from mindless thinking and had us seeking for more, many other complications that troubled mankind were eventually vanquished with all records of them being forgotten by many. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                BUT NOT US.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Decades after the beginning of the space race, mankind’s original planet “Earth” was running out of space to house people. The people in power decided that those who have committed crimes of any kind were to be exiled and sent to the cosmos.
                Fortunately, the knowledge that the outcasts brought along with them helped in finding peace and comfort in their damnation. They built their own civilization separate from those who lived on mankind’s home planet and established order. 
                Centuries passed and those who remained on Earth perished, but those who were once called outcasts eventually carried the burden to carry on humanity’s legacy.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                THIS DOES NOT MATTER.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                It was sudden. Stars disappeared and many perished. The reason for their disappearance is unknown.
                The universe is dying. The planets that we have once lived on are no longer habitable. 
                All of mankind now lives in a makeshift space-hub that houses approximately 400,00 people.
                I was lucky to get into one of the ships.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                SOON, ALL WILL CEASE TO EXIST.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, just like the original case of those who were exiled on Earth, us criminals who inhabit the space-hub will be exiled and forced to explore the cosmos forever. However, they proposed that whoever among us can find a reason as to why the stars disappeared will be pardoned and have the choice to return to the hub. I still have a chance.

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                A chance to return...
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                A chance to repent...
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                A chance to be humanity’s savior.    
                <br>
